# Tensor Reprogram: mu-Parameterisation and mu-Transfer reproduction
## Setup
Install all the required modules:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Install this repository in editable mode
```
pip install -e .
```
### Weights and Biases Logging Setup:
Go to https://wandb.ai/ and log in to retrieve your API key. Make sure you have `wandb` pip installed, and run the following from the command line:
```wandb login```

See https://docs.wandb.ai/quickstart for more info.

If running from an automated environement (e.g. a cluster), you can set-up wandb using environment variables (see https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/track/environment-variables).

## Run:
```
python3 scripts/run.py
```
To change any options...


## Description:
The $\mu$-parameterization is implemented in 3 steps:
- (optional) `infer_inf_type`: Input a model and output a mapping (`dict`) from parameter names to the type of that parameter that represents its scaling behaviour (in $\mu P$ there are roughly 3 types,:1) input matrices and vectors, 2) hidden layer matrices, 3) output matrices)
- `mup_initialise`: Take model parameters and information about their type (output from `infer_inf_type` or specified manually), and initialise each parameter adequately
- `get_mup_{sgd,adam}_param_groups`: Take model parameters and information about their type (output from `infer_inf_type` or specified manually), as well as tunable optim. param scales, and return parameter groups that can be passed to a `torch` optimiser and are adequately scaled wrt. width.
